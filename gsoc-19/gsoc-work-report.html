                <h3>About JPF</h3>
                <p>JPF is a model checking tool for Java applications. JPF-core is the core structure of
                    JPF. It is a Virtual Machine (VM) for Java bytecode which executes the system under
                    test (SUT). While execution semantics of Java bytecodes are clearly defined in Sun's 
                    Java virtual machine specifications, the semantics are hardwired in JPF - the VM 
                    instruction set is represented by a set of classes that can be replaced. JPF is a special VM.
                    JPF itself is written in Java, so it is not as fast as your normal Java. That implies that JPF is VM
                    which is running on top of another VM.
                </P>
                <P>    
                    As JPF executes the SUT, it checks for certain properties which are given to JPF as input. 
                    Some of the properties that can be checked by JPF are unhandled exceptions, deadlocks, 
                    and user-defined assertions which are used to test properties of the code's behavior. 
                    After the execution of the SUT, JPF gives a detailed report on the properties which hold 
                    and verification artifacts that have been created by JPF for further analysis (like test cases).

                        migrating JPF from java version 8 to 11.

                        The arrival of Java 9 introduced some interesting changes like the module system, handling strings, etc 
                        to the javac compiler and the Java internals.
                    </p>
                    <p class="my-work">
                        Prior to my work, all classes were compiled as part of the default module. 
                        Many module classes did not compile anymore under this setup, 
                        because packages with the same names can exist in different modules. This is because 
                        split packages are not supported from java version 9. To compile the module classes I used --patch-module compiler option in gradle. 
                    </p>

                                    --patch-module is used to override classes in module. It can also be used to augment the contents of a module. 
                                    The --patch-module option is also supported by javac to compile code "as if" part of the module.

                        The next task was to fix string concatenation. This was a major task as it was the main reason for test failures. For example, concatenating
                        directory paths, expressions, etc.
                    </p>
                </div> 
                <p>
                    Java 9 changed the way how strings were handled.
                    To know more about the changes in handling strings, lets take a simple example of string concatenation.
                </p>

                    <h4>Compiler changes:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The change is in the Java bytecode that the javac compiler outputs. In Java version 8 and earlier, the last line of our source code 
                        snippet above would compile to the following bytecode        
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-snippet-output">
                        <img src="../assets/gsoc/string-concatenation/java_8-output.PNG"> 
                    </div> 
                    <p>      
                        The bytecode that is generated now is much shorter, but also introduces two new elements: 
                        an invokedynamic instruction and a bootstrap method.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-snippet-output">
                        <img src="../assets/gsoc/string-concatenation/java_11-output.PNG">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As stated in the project description of Java 9, the reason for this change is to enable future optimizations of String concatenation 
                        without requiring further changes to the bytecode produced by javac.
                        And dynamic method invocation is the ideal solution for that because it delays the method invocation to the runtime.                        
                    </p>               
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Dynamic method invocation in java:</h4>
                    <p>
                        First, the compiler places the invokedynamic instruction in the method body to indicate the use of a dynamic method there. 
                        This invokeDynamic instruction refers to a bootstrap method which is a regular Java method stored in a special attribute in the class file.
                        During runtime, this bootstrap method is called to dynamically create the method which is being invoked and wrap it in a container object
                        called a CallSite. Finally, the JVM extracts a MethodHandle for the newly generated method from the CallSite and executes the method,
                        manipulating the stack as if it were a regular method invocation.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        The marker character \u0001 indicates whether the method should consume an argument from the stack or load an argument 
                        from the constants passed to the bootstrap method                   
                    </p>
                </div>

                                The previous version of this method was limited to loading lambda expressions, which are also compiled 
                                to bootstrap methods. Other types of bootstrap methods were introduced with 
                                Java 9, with different numbers of parameters, which were not correctly loaded before this work.
                                Another important part of this work was to get the write method descriptor for string concatenation.

                        I have improved the test success rate from 20% to 90%.
