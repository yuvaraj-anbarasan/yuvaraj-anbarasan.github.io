                <p>Java Pathfinder (JPF) is a model checking tool for Java applications. <a href="https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core">JPF-core</a> is the core structure of
                    JPF. It is a Virtual Machine (VM) for Java bytecode which executes the system under
                    test (SUT). While the execution semantics of Java bytecodes are clearly defined in Sun's 
                    Java virtual machine specifications, the semantics are hardwired in JPF - the VM 
                    instruction set is represented by a set of classes that can be replaced. JPF is a special VM.
                    JPF itself is written in Java, so it is not as fast as your normal Java. That implies that JPF is VM
                    which is running on top of another VM.
                </P>
                <P>    
                    As JPF executes the SUT, it checks for certain properties which are given to JPF as input. 
                    Some of the properties that can be checked by JPF are unhandled exceptions, deadlocks, 
                    and user-defined assertions which are used to test properties of the code's behavior. 
                    After the execution of the SUT, JPF gives a detailed report on the properties which hold 
                    and verification artifacts that have been created by JPF for further analysis (like test cases).

                        The arrival of Java 9 introduced some interesting changes like the module system, handling strings, etc 
                        to the javac compiler and the Java internals. These changes caused various issues in JPF since a lot classes
                        are dependent on the host JVM's implementation.

                        JPF can be viewed as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in itself. JPF has it's own implementation of the VM. Basically,
                        JPF is a virtual machine (VM) running on top of the JVM. The class (.class) files, and even the same files at times,
                        are processed in two different ways in a JVM running JPF
                        - as any other Java classes managed and executed by the host JVM (standard Java library classes, JPF implementation classes)
                        - as "modeled" classes managed and processed (verified) by JPF

                        Each standard JVM supports a so called Java Native Interface (JNI), that is used to delegate execution from the Java level 
                        (i.e. JVM controlled bytecode) down into the (platform dependent) native layer (machine code). This is normally used to interface 
                        certain functionalities to the platform OS / architecture (e.g. I/O or graphics).

                        Interestingly enough, there exists a analogous need to lower the "execution" level in JPF, from JPF controlled bytecode into JVM 
                        controlled bytecode. According to this analogy, the JPF specific interface is called Model Java interface (MJI).

                        JPF has its own set of model classes which are used as a substitute for the JVM classes. These classes have native methods, for which
                        the execution is delegated to the JVM. The delegation is done using the Model Java Interface (MJI). And the implementation is done 
                        in the native peer of the model class.

                        // native interface explanation
                        // module system
                    </p>

                        With these changes module classes were compiled successfully and the build was successful.

                        The next task was to fix string concatenation. This was a major task as it was the main reason for test failures. For example, concatenating
                        directory paths, expressions, etc.
                    </p>
                </div> 
                <p>
                    Java 9 changed the way how strings were handled.
                    To know more about the changes in handling strings, let's take a simple example of string concatenation.

                <div>
                    <h4>Compiler changes:</h4>
                    <p>
                        The change is in the Java bytecode that the javac compiler outputs. In Java version 8 and earlier, the last line of our source code 
                        snippet above would compile to the following bytecode        
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-snippet-output">
                        <img src="../assets/gsoc/string-concatenation/java_8-output.PNG"> 
                    </div> 
                    <p>      
                        The bytecode that is generated now is much shorter, but also introduces two new elements: 
                        an invokedynamic instruction and a bootstrap method.
                    </p>
                    <div class="code-snippet-output">
                        <img src="../assets/gsoc/string-concatenation/java_11-output.PNG">
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        As stated in the project description of Java 9, the reason for this change is to enable future optimizations of String concatenation 
                        without requiring further changes to the bytecode produced by javac.
                        And dynamic method invocation is the ideal solution for that because it delays the method invocation to runtime.                        
                    </p>

                <div>
                    <h4>Dynamic method invocation in java:</h4>
                    <p>
                        First, the compiler places the invokedynamic instruction in the method body to indicate the use of a dynamic method there. 
                        This invokeDynamic instruction refers to a bootstrap method which is a regular Java method stored in a special attribute in the class file.
                        During runtime, this bootstrap method is called to dynamically create the method which is being invoked and wrap it in a container object
                        called a CallSite. Finally, the JVM extracts a MethodHandle for the newly generated method from the CallSite and executes the method,
                        manipulating the stack as if it were a regular method invocation.
                    </p>
                    <p>  
                        The marker character \u0001 indicates whether the method should consume an argument from the stack or load an argument 
                        from the constants passed to the bootstrap method                   
                    </p>

                                The previous version of this method was limited to loading lambda expressions, which are also compiled 
                                to bootstrap methods. Other types of bootstrap methods were introduced with 
                                Java 9, with different numbers of parameters, which were not correctly loaded before this work.
                                Another important part of this work was to get the right method descriptor for string concatenation.

                <p>
                    It was a great experience working for three months on my project for Java Pathfinder under Google Summer of Code. 
                    I sincerely thank my mentors Cyrille Artho and Pavel Pavel Parizek whose support, guidance and continuous encouragement helped me immensely 
                    in bringing this work where it stands.
                    Thanks, Google and Java Pathfinder for giving me this opportunity. 
                </p>
