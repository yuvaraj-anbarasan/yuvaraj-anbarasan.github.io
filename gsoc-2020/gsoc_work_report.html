                <p>Java Pathfinder (JPF) is a model checking tool for Java applications. <a href="https://github.com/javapathfinder/jpf-core">JPF-core</a> is the core structure of
                    JPF. It is a Virtual Machine (VM) for Java bytecode which executes the system under
                    test (SUT). While the execution semantics of Java bytecodes are clearly defined in Sun's 
                    Java virtual machine specifications, the semantics are hardwired in JPF - the VM 
                    instruction set is represented by a set of classes that can be replaced. JPF is a special VM.
                    JPF itself is written in Java, so it is not as fast as your normal Java. That implies that JPF is VM
                    which is running on top of another VM.
                </P>
                <P>    
                    As JPF executes the SUT, it checks for certain properties which are given to JPF as input. 
                    Some of the properties that can be checked by JPF are unhandled exceptions, deadlocks, 
                    and user-defined assertions which are used to test properties of the code's behavior. 
                    After the execution of the SUT, JPF gives a detailed report on the properties which hold 
                    and verification artifacts that have been created by JPF for further analysis (like test cases).

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    The arrival of Java 9 introduced some interesting changes like the module system, handling strings, etc 
                    to the javac compiler and the Java internals. These changes caused various issues in JPF since a lot classes
                    are dependent on the host JVM's implementation.
                </p>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        JPF can be viewed as a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in itself. JPF has it's own implementation of the VM. Basically,
                        JPF is a virtual machine (VM) running on top of the JVM. The class (.class) files at times are processed in two different ways 
                        in a JVM running JPF-core
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>as any other Java classes managed and executed by the host JVM (standard Java library classes, JPF implementation classes)</li>
                        <li>as "modeled" classes managed and processed (verified) by JPF</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Each standard JVM supports a so called Java Native Interface (JNI), that is used to delegate execution from the Java level 
                    (i.e. JVM controlled bytecode) down into the (platform dependent) native layer (native method libraries). 
                    The primary goal is binary compatibility of native method libraries across all Java virtual machine implementations on a given 
                    platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interestingly enough, there exists a analogous need to lower the "execution" level in JPF, from JPF controlled bytecode into JVM 
                    controlled bytecode. According to this analogy, the JPF specific interface is called Model Java interface (MJI), which is used to
                    find or check mangled version of the native method when JPF encounters a native method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JPF also has its own set of model classes which are used as a substitute for the JVM classes. The main reason for having model 
                    classes is that a lot of the functionalities can be implemented that the native methods have in simple Java code. Sometimes there exists a
                    need to delegate the execution of a method to the host JVM and this is again done by declaring a function native using the native keyword.
                    The native are invoked in the JVM using reflection, with the arguments drawn from the Model Java Interface environment (MJI).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the native method implementation of JPF is depenedent on the host JVM's implementation, a lot of issues occured when migrating JPF from
                    java 8 to 11.

                            Fixed <label class="highlight-text">java.lang.String.computeStringHashCode</label> native peer . Previously (in java 8 and lower 
                            versions), String values were stored as characters, and the string hash was computed as,
                            <div class="highlight-block">
                            s[0]*31^(n-1) + s[1]*31^(n-2) + ... + s[n-1]
                            </div>
                            where s[i] was a character. This changed in java 9 and above versions, where s[i] is of type byte. Therefore, the existing logic didn't
                            work since it tried to get char array instead of byte array. This PR fixed this issue by changing the logic to get byte array.

                            Since module system was introduced in java 9, the accessibilty of classes entirely depends on the modules instead of packages.
                            Modularity adds a higher level of aggregation above packages. With module system, all the classes are dependent on the module info.
                            Every class has its own module info. Module info contains details about class module. One such case which caused issue in JPF
                            is <label class="highlight-text">Package.getPackages</label>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <label class="highlight-text">Package.getPackages</label> inernally calls the 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Module</label> class method which again calls <label class="highlight-text">Package</label> class,
                            and as a result of mutual dependency between the two classes, the call to <label class="highlight-text">Package.getPackges</label>
                             was going into an infinite loop, causing a StackOverFlowError.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This issue occured because the logic in setting bootstrap method (<label class="highlight-text">JVMClassInfo.setBootstrapMethod</label>) to get 
                            enclosing lambda or class, was unable to partially resolve the classes. Hence everytime when enclosing class 
                            was not found, the class of again loaded if not already resolved. In this case, before Package class getting 
                            fully resolved, the Module class was called which again was not resolved. Hence resulted to infinte loop.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This issue was fixed by adding model class for Module class. Since the model classes are already resolved at JPF load time, when 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Package</label> class calls <label class="highlight-text">Module</label> class, the ClassLoader 
                            fetches the resolved model class.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another issue related to <label class="highlight-text">Package</label> class was, package version info initialization.
                             A few fields related to Package were missing and were moved to the 
                            inner class <label class="highlight-text">VersionInfo</label> of <label class="highlight-text">Package</label>
                             class. This issue was fixed by resolving <label class="highlight-text">VersionInfo</label> class and
                             initializing the fields in this class.

                            and return the <label class="highlight-text">Enumeration</label> instead the converting 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Arraylist</label> to <label class="highlight-text">Enumeration</label> and returning it.

                            Removed model class for <label class="highlight-text">Module</label> class and added logic to get partially resolved classes when 
                            seting bootstrap method (in<label class="highlight-text">JVMClassInfo.setBootstrapMethod</label>).

                        <p>
                            Also, added <label class="highlight-text">Class.getModuleName</label> method to model and native peer classes
                            to get module name of a class. The method is implemented in the native peer to make use of the host JVM's 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Class.getModule</label>. 
                            Using <label class="highlight-text">Class.getModule</label>, and based on whether the resolved or loaded class is a 
                            JPF class or not, the module name was added to
                            the class path in <label class="highlight-text">Class.getResource</label> accordingly. This fixed the issue with 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Class.getResource</label> method.

                            Added <label class="highlight-text">getUnalignedLong</label> method to <label class="highlight-text">jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe</label>
                            class native peer. The implementation of <label class="highlight-text">Arrays.equals</label> was changed since java 9. It leverages vector-based techniques to access and
                             compare the contents of two arrays (to make the comparison efficient). To access the contents of the array, 
                             <label class="highlight-text">Unsafe.getLongUnaligned</label> is used. This method uses Unsafe.getLong to get value of the array based on the offset value.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since, the type of the array was not long, JPF was throwing an exception. This was becasue the offset value passed to 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Unsafe.getLongUnaligned</label> method was the index of the array instead of the offset value. 
                            The offset value should have been,
                        </p>
                        <div class="highlight-block">
                            ((array Object's base index) - (offset of long type)) - ((array Object's base index) - (offset of array type (i.e, int, float, double, etc)))
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Hence <label class="highlight-text">Unsafe.getLongUnaligned</label> logic was not woking as expected. And since the method calculating 
                            is a host JVM class, the solution to this issue was to add and implement <label class="highlight-text">Unsafe.getLongUnaligned</label> in 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Unsafe</label> native peer class. 
                            The native peer method, uses the type of the array instead of offset to return the right value.

                            <label class="highlight-text">Class.newInstance</label> was deprecated in Java 9. It can be replaced by 
                            <label class="highlight-text">clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()</label>.
                            But the problem is that <label class="highlight-text">getDeclaredConstructor</label> returns any 
                            constructor without regarding the access level. Hence, <label class="highlight-text">clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()</label>  
                            was not throwing any exception when instance of inaccessible constructors were created as JPF's
                            implementaton of <label class="highlight-text">Constructor.newInstance</label> was not checking access levels of constructors.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fixed this issue by adding logic to check access level of the caller class in 
                            <label class="highlight-text">Constructor.newInstance</label> native peer.

                <p>
                    It was a great experience working for three months on my project for Java Pathfinder under Google Summer of Code. 
                    I sincerely thank my mentors <label class="bold-text">Cyrille Artho</label> and <label class="bold-text">Pavel Parizek</label> whose 
                    support, guidance and continuous encouragement helped me immensely in bringing this work where it stands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks, Google and Java Pathfinder for giving me this opportunity.
